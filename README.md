# Hello ! 

This is the source code for the second mini project I completed for STAT 228: Intro to Data Science at Simmons University. 
The aim for this project was to give a tutorial detailing the data cleaning and wrangling process with dplyr functions. I chose to use a data set
which detailed the statistics of survivalists on the TV Series Alone. I've included the brief introduction from the blog post down below.

# Data Cleaning + Wrangling in R

## An example using Alone survivalists

Alone is a survival show which started in the US and has now expanded to Australia. 
The premise of the show is for several survival experts to try to outlast each other in the wilderness 
with limited survival supplies and in complete isolation. See the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alone_(TV_series)) 
for further details on the series.

Statistician Daniel Oehm created 4 excellent data sets containing various statistics from the TV series. M
ore info about the data sets can be found on his [blog](https://gradientdescending.com/alone-r-package-datasets-from-the-survival-tv-series/) 
and on the [github repository](https://github.com/doehm/alone) containing the source code.
